# Full-Fledged-Network
In this project, I designed a full-fledged network for an organization with multiple subnets using CISCO packet tracer. Here, I used 3 different types of IP addresses. Configured the whole network in such a way that IP for the hosts of different networks will be automatically assigned by a single DHCP server.
